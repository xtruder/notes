# Preface

## The story

## The culture

Let's build team that is close to ideal. And here is where it all starts with team
culture. It's about how team solves the problems, how coworkers help each other,
how they share their wisdom. Break the hierarchy, build a society.

## Hiring

TODO: hiring 

### Yay, new team member

Let's not start with development, let's start with socializing. You have to be
aware that you could be working with other team members for quite some time.
It's good to make them feel at home, to show them that you care and to show them
that you are not just a bunch of cold blooded working robots, but actual persons.

Take them for a lunch, bake them a cake, 3d print them a welcome gift,... 
Let other team members be there, it's everyone's time to celebreate a new awesome
member.

Whenever new deloper comes, ask him what he likes to do in his free time.
Does he like to sport, does he like to code, does he like to party, ...
Find other team member(s) with similar interesets and possibly similar personalities
and engage these people to do things together. Encourage them go climbing, let them go
to a party, let them hack 3d printers, let them just chill. This will be best time
spent and will accelerate your productivity greatly.

## Transaparency

It's important to keep company as transparent as possible. This will greatly affect
coworkers trust. It's better to tell people, why you can't share some information,
as to just keep it secret.

### For the privacy, break the secrecy

There's a big margin between privacy and secrecy.

Privacy means one is not ready to share most private things with everyone else.
Privacy is ok, eveyone wants to have some privacy and does not want to share
every private thing with everyone else.

Secrecy means that a person does not want to share basic informations with others
that are generally going to be his coworkers and his friends in a first place.
Secrecy is generally bad, it breaks transparency, and trust. It is not ok
to keep things secret for unexplained reasons, for a team that trusts each other.

## Workplace

### It's not about the look, it's about the feel

You just got a new investment and are looking for a new offices. Because you have
the money, you are willing to buy the most fancy place in town. It will be like
marble everywhere, your lobby will have one of those victoria secret models that
will meet people and you will have a cocnut watter and pigeon food everywehere(snacks).
Also, you will look like a dusche.

While the business you are making might need offices that look professional, you
can still avoid being a dusche. It's much better to invest in people feeling
welcome and nice, as to invest in overpaid fancy offices, that most coworkers
will feel awkward in.

### Let geeks, stay geeks

While you might need to have different culture for business, let's not addopt
everyting to fit this look and feel. Geeks are generally not people that will
come in office wearing a suit and a tie, and you should not be expecting this from them.
They are creative people, and you need to let them have their creativity. Let them
bring their 3d printers, their ethereum miners, their drones to the office.
Keep their creative chaos and let them hang where they want. They don't
generally need an office, they need just a space to feel comfortable in. Expect
them to migrate from one place to another and hang with different teams. This is
all good, there should be no barriers.

## Coworker relations

### Dispute resolution

### Love, anger, hate, depression and other feelings

Different feeling between coworkers will affect your working environment. It's
part of life and part of society. If team trusts each other and is transparent,
any issues will be much easier to resolve. While not everyone will share their
personal feelings, it's encouraged for people to trust and talk, so these
tensions can be resolved faster and better.

#### The Love

It's generally ok to have love relations betweene coworkers. Love is a strong 
feeling and can benefit as much, as it can cause problems. It's important to
keep things in way, that don't affect other coworkers and keep work relation
as transparent and proffesional as possible. Prohibition of love in company is
like prohibition of weed, you can do it, but people are still going to break the
rule. In general it will cause no harm, but it's important to keep it within norms.

#### Problem resolution
