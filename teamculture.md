# Preface

## The culture

Let's build team that is close to ideal. And here is where it all starts with team
culture. It's about how team solves the problems, how coworkers help each other,
how they share their wisdom. Break the hierarchy, build a society.

## Hiring

TODO: hiring 

### Yay, new team member

Let's not start with development, let's start with socializing. You have to be
aware that you could be working with other team members for quite some time.
It's good to make them feel at home, to show them that you care and to show them
that you are not just a bunch of cold blooded working robots, but actual persons.

Take them for a lunch, bake them a cake, 3d print them a welcome gift,... 
Let other team members be there, it's everyone's time to celebreate a new awesome
member.

Whenever new deloper comes, ask him what he likes to do in his free time.
Does he like to sport, does he like to code, does he like to party, ...
Find other team member(s) with similar interesets and possibly similar personalities
and engage these people to do things together. Encourage them go climbing, let them go
to a party, let them hack 3d printers, let them just chill. This will be best time
spent and will accelerate your productivity greatly.

## Engineering process

Enginerring process is not just about how engineers deliver a product that would be
created and work efficiently, but also what they learn, how they share and reuse
knowledge and how it benefits the future of the whole company. It's much more as
just delivering MVP, that is usefull for one use case, but does not benefit company
as a whole.

### Knowledge gap

In company you will usually have engineers with various level of knowledge, some
will be juniors, middle and senior engineers. Not everyone can deliver and 
develop any kind of tasks and junior engineers will do simple tasks, while seniors
will do harder ones. The most important point is that code quality should not
be affected greatly. This might seem contradictory at first, but knowledge sharing,
work reviews and comments will make this happen.

#### Knowledge sharing

It's important for engineers to share knowledge with those
who need to know more. This should be baked into team culture. Engineers can use
various medium for knowledge sharing, like writing it, having presentations or
just having tendency to ask around what problem others have. Up to 20% of the
work should be just dedicated helping others, and it should be a priority right
after critical tasks. This behaviour should be rewarded and encouraged. It's
imporant to note, that knowledge sharing should be also as efficient as possible.
Writing it down or having (possibly recorded) presentations, will shorten the time
one has to describe same things all over again, and for any given question one can
just share a pre-written document like this one. It's also usefull to have a
collection material, like books, links, and other, that you can share with coworkers. 

#### Work review

Every work done should be reviewed by other coworkers that are able to review
particular work done. Besides sharing the knowledge it's the only way how to
improve yourself and others. For software engineers code reviews are a standard
process. Work reviews should be as strict as possible. While it should be
agreed on, which work should be fixed, it does not ease work review process. 
Mistakes or bad practices should not be repeated, and work review will help
with that.

Work reviews should be also done for senior engineers. While it might seem that
these people know everything, it's usually because of their wide knowledge or
laziness, that they forget many imporant things. The other benefit of doing
work reviews from less experienced coworkers is that they will learn new things,
and ask questions. This process benefits both sides.

## Transaparency

It's important to keep company as transparent as possible. This will greatly affect
coworkers trust. It's better to tell people, why you can't share some information,
as to just keep it secret.

### For the privacy, break the secrecy

There's a big margin between privacy and secrecy.

Privacy means one is not ready to share most private things with everyone else.
Privacy is ok, eveyone wants to have some privacy and does not want to share
every private thing with everyone else.

Secrecy means that a person does not want to share basic informations with others
that are generally going to be his coworkers and his friends in a first place.
Secrecy is generally bad, it breaks transparency, and trust. It is not ok
to keep things secret for unexplained reasons, for a team that trusts each other.

## Workplace

### It's not about the look, it's about the feel

You just got a new investment and are looking for a new offices. Because you have
the money, you are willing to buy the most fancy place in town. It will be like
marble everywhere, your lobby will have one of those victoria secret models that
will meet people and you will have a cocnut watter and pigeon food everywehere(snacks).
Also, you will look like a dusche.

While the business you are making might need offices that look professional, you
can still avoid being a dusche. It's much better to invest in people feeling
welcome and nice, as to invest in overpaid fancy offices, that most coworkers
will feel awkward in.

### Let geeks, stay geeks

While you might need to have different culture for business, let's not addopt
everyting to fit this look and feel. Geeks are generally not people that will
come in office wearing a suit and a tie, and you should not be expecting this from them.
They are creative people, and you need to let them have their creativity. Let them
bring their 3d printers, their ethereum miners, their drones to the office.
Keep their creative chaos and let them hang where they want. They don't
generally need an office, they need just a space to feel comfortable in. Expect
them to migrate from one place to another and hang with different teams. This is
all good, there should be no barriers.

## Coworker relations

### Dispute resolution

### Love, anger, hate, depression and other feelings

Different feeling between coworkers will affect your working environment. It's
part of life and part of society. If team trusts each other and is transparent,
any issues will be much easier to resolve. While not everyone will share their
personal feelings, it's encouraged for people to trust and talk, so these
tensions can be resolved faster and better.

#### The Love

It's generally ok to have love relations betweene coworkers. Love is a strong 
feeling and can benefit as much, as it can cause problems. It's important to
keep things in way, that don't affect other coworkers and keep work relation
as transparent and proffesional as possible. Prohibition of love in company is
like prohibition of weed, you can do it, but people are still going to break the
rule. In general it will cause no harm, but it's important to keep it within norms.

#### Problem resolution
